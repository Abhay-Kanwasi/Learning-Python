## Basic Concepts

This folder contains Python code examples and programs that cover the fundamental concepts of Python. You will find topics such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and more. These foundational concepts are essential for every Python programmer, and they provide the building blocks for creating more complex applications.

## Date

In this section, you'll find Python programs related to handling dates and time. Understanding how to work with date objects, format dates, calculate date differences, and perform other date-related operations is crucial for applications dealing with time-sensitive data or events. Python offers powerful libraries like `datetime` and `time` to simplify date and time manipulation.

## File Handling

Explore Python programs for file handling tasks, such as reading, writing, and manipulating files. File handling is a fundamental aspect of programming as it allows you to store and retrieve data from external sources, such as databases, text files, and configuration files. Learn how to open, read, write, and close files, as well as how to handle exceptions related to file operations.

## Generator

Learn about Python generators and find code examples demonstrating their usage. Generators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to create iterators in a more concise and memory-efficient manner. Unlike regular functions that use the `return` keyword to return a value once, generators use the `yield` keyword to produce a sequence of values over time. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

## List

Discover Python list-related code snippets and programs in this section. Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python. They are used to store collections of items, such as numbers, strings, or objects. You will learn how to create lists, manipulate their elements, iterate over them using loops, and perform common list operations, such as slicing, sorting, and searching.

## Modules

This section contains Python code related to modules, allowing you to understand their usage and functionality. Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported into other programs. They help in organizing code and promoting code reusability. In this section, you will learn how to create your own modules, import modules from the Python Standard Library, and use third-party modules from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Explore Python's object-oriented programming paradigm with code examples and projects. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to represent and interact with data and behavior. It provides a structured way to model real-world entities and their interactions. In this section, you will learn about classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. You will also see how to implement these concepts in Python to create well-organized and maintainable code.

## Practice Python

Put your Python skills to the test with practice exercises covering various concepts. Reinforce your understanding of Python programming with a set of coding challenges and tasks. This section is designed to help you apply what you've learned in real-world scenarios and improve your problem-solving skills. Each exercise provides a description of the problem and a set of input/output examples, encouraging you to write Python code to solve the given challenges.

## Scripting

This section contains Python scripts for automating tasks and simplifying repetitive actions. Python is a versatile language for scripting, making it a popular choice for automation tasks. From simple file manipulation to complex system automation, Python's scripting capabilities are diverse. In this section, you will find examples of Python scripts that perform system operations, data processing, and other automation tasks. By studying these scripts, you will gain insight into how Python can be used to streamline various processes and improve productivity.

## Searching and Sorting

Learn about searching and sorting algorithms with Python programs. Searching and sorting are fundamental algorithms used to efficiently find specific elements in a collection or to arrange the elements in a specific order. In this section, you will explore various searching algorithms, such as binary search and linear search, as well as sorting algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort. Understanding these algorithms will help you optimize the performance of your Python programs when dealing with large datasets.

## Top 100 Programs

Explore a collection of top 100 Python programs covering a wide range of concepts and challenges. These programs are carefully curated to encompass various aspects of Python programming, ranging from simple beginner exercises to more complex coding challenges. By working through these programs, you will encounter diverse problem-solving scenarios and gain valuable experience in writing efficient and elegant Python code.

## Automation Testing

Find Python code and projects related to automation testing with testing frameworks. Automated testing is an essential part of software development that helps ensure the quality and reliability of software products. Python offers several testing frameworks, such as PyTest and unittest, that facilitate the creation and execution of automated tests. In this section, you will explore Python code examples that demonstrate how to write automated tests for various aspects of software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
